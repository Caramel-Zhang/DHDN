# Project README

## Project Introduction
This project is based on the dataset from the WISIG repository. For more details, please refer to the WISIG dataset [here][(https://github.com/wisig/wisig-dataset)](https://github.com/WiSig-dataset/wisig-examples)). Python 3.10 is required for running the provided code.

## Script Organization
Organizing the complete set of scripts is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Therefore, we have provided key code snippets to get you started. We will continue to work on organizing the full set of scripts and will release them in the future.

## Future Plans
The repository will only be shared after evaluation. It will not be publicly released until the associated paper is published.
